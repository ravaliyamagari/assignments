CSS:Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files


Internal Stylesheet:An internal stylesheet holds the CSS code for the webpage in the head section of the particular file. This makes it easy to apply styles like classes or id's in order to reuse the code. The downside of using an internal stylesheet is that changes to the internal stylesheet only effect the page the code is inserted into.

When creating a stylesheet internally in the web page, you will need to use the <style></style> HTML tags in the Head section of your webpage. All the code for the Internal CSS stylesheet is contained between the <head></head> section of your websites code. Below is an example of what an Internal stylesheet looks like.

<head>

  <style type="text/css">
    h1 {color:blue;}
    h2 {color:red;}
    p {color:green;}
  </style>

</head>


Inline Styles:The Inline style is specific to the tag itself. The inline style uses the HTML "style" attribute to style a specific tag. This is not recommended, as every CSS change has to be made in every tag that has the inline style applied to it. The Inline style is good for one an individual CSS change that you do not use repeatedly through the site.
The inline style uses the HTML "style" attribute. This allows CSS properties on a "per tag" basis. The following is an example of how the inline style is used.

<p style="color:red;font-size:18px">This is a paragraph!</p>
This inline style will change the color of the paragraph to red and make the font size 18 pixels.
